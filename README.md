I only made some modifications based on the original author's code, such as removing the arm, we did not need the arm, modified the body color, fixed the character position, and demonstrated that the compiler relied on the convenience of subsequent investigation, so it was easy to start

Thank you very much for sharing. the original author's code link：

这个一个实现3D人物行走的demo, 基于一个大神的工程稍微做了一点修改，整理了一下依赖，

依赖 glut32的库，需要下载到本地，并拷贝到相应的路径，见上文英文描述。
